# Suspected Data Exfiltration Incident Report

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Case ID / Title:** Suspected Data Exfiltration from PIPd Employee (`danielletargetm`) 
- **Date Range Investigated:** May 31, 2025 - June 2, 2025
- **Analyst:** Danielle Morris
- **Environment:** Environment: Cyber Range / Lab (Simulation Environment)
- **Goal:** Investigate potential data theft by John Doe.
- **Compromised Host:** `danielletargetm`
- **Targeted Account(s):** John Doe 
- **Summary:** An investigation into `danielletargetm` revealed strong indicators of automated data exfiltration. A malicious PowerShell script (`exfiltratedata.ps1`) was executed, which silently installed 7-Zip, generated and compressed fake employee data, and then uploaded it to an external Azure Blob Storage account using embedded credentials. The script also attempted to clean up its local footprint. This activity shows a consistent and highly suspicious pattern, indicating a sustained threat.

## 2. Scenario Overview

This investigation was initiated based on concerns from management regarding John Doe, an employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), and the potential for data theft from his assigned machine, `danielletargetm`. The scenario simulated a sophisticated data exfiltration attempt using scripting and legitimate tools for malicious purposes. The threat behavior involves the use of Living Off The Land Binaries (LOLBins) like PowerShell and `7z.exe` to achieve its objectives.

## 3. Mission & Hypothesis

- **Mission:** To determine if data exfiltration is occurring on `danielletargetm` and to identify the methods used.
- **Hypothesis:** John Doe is staging or compressing sensitive files before exfiltration.
- **Expected Techniques:** PowerShell execution, file compression, data transfer to external locations, and potential cleanup activities.

## 4. Methodology

- **Frameworks:** MITRE ATT&CK, PEAK (Prepare, Enrich, Analyze, Act, Confirm, Know)
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- **Query Language:** Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- **Steps Followed:** Initial queries were performed on `DeviceFileEvents` to look for suspicious `.zip` file activity. Timelines around suspicious file creations were investigated using `DeviceProcessEvents` to identify initiating processes. Script analysis was performed once `exfiltratedata.ps1` was identified.

* **What We Found:**
    Our process investigation revealed that a PowerShell script (`exfiltratedata.ps1`) was executed around the time of the `.zip` file creation. This script was launched by `cmd.exe` and operated with High integrity (elevated privileges). Further analysis indicated that this script was responsible for silently installing `7-Zip` (`7z2408-x64.exe`), which was subsequently used for the observed data compression.

* **Interpretation:**
    This chain of events indicates automated and elevated execution of a script that downloads and installs unauthorized software, directly leading to data preparation. The use of PowerShell with `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` is a significant red flag for malicious activity, as it bypasses security controls.

* **Mapped MITRE Techniques:**

| Tactic          | Technique ID | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Phase 3 - Exfiltration

- **PEAK Step:** Analyze, Act
- **MITRE Tactics:** Exfiltration
- **Techniques Expected / Validated:** T1567.002 (Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage)

* **What We Investigated:**
    Following the identification and initial analysis of the `exfiltratedata.ps1` script in Phase 2, we conducted a deeper examination of its code to understand its external communication capabilities and data exfiltration mechanisms.

* **Relevant Code Block:**

   ![VM Script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c86db8-1d94-490e-87e9-848edd8a2c32)

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5944d58-9655-4891-bdd6-aedff923b96e)

* **What We Found:**
    The `exfiltratedata.ps1` script contained hardcoded Azure Blob Storage variables, including a target URL (`https://sacyberrangedanger.blob.core.windows.windows.net/stolencompanydata/employee-data.zip`) and a critical hardcoded storage key. The script was designed to use `Invoke-WebRequest` to upload the compressed zip file directly to this external Azure Blob Storage URL.


* **Interpretation:**
    This constitutes the core exfiltration event, where the collected and compressed data is transferred to an unauthorized external cloud storage. The presence of a hardcoded storage key represents a severe security vulnerability, granting direct access to the storage account.

* **Mapped MITRE Techniques:**

| Tactic       | Technique ID | Description                                                    |
| :----------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exfiltration | T1567.002    | Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage - The script specifically uploaded data to an Azure Blob Storage account, a form of cloud storage. |

### Phase 4 - Persistence & Defense Evasion

**PEAK Step:** Enrich, Confirm
**MITRE Tactics:** Persistence, Defense Evasion
**Techniques Expected / Validated:** T1564.001 (Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories), T1070.004 (File Deletion)

* **What We Investigated:**
    Continuing our analysis of the `exfiltratedata.ps1` script (identified in Phase 2), we reviewed its code for any post-exfiltration cleanup routines or mechanisms designed to establish persistence or evade detection.

* **Relevant Code Block:**
  
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e62613e-77a1-4ff1-adb2-2223a733b044)

    ---

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3163c479-f5ef-4ead-9891-b3bce0ed56db)

* **What We Found:**
    After successfully uploading the data, the script performed cleanup actions by moving both the generated temporary CSV file and the compressed zip file into a non-standard backup directory (`C:\ProgramData\backup\`). Additionally, it was found to log activity to an obscure log file (`C:\ProgramData\entropygorilla.log`).

* **Interpretation:**
    These actions represent an attempt by the attacker to manage their local footprint and avoid detection. Moving files to a "backup" directory and logging to an obscure file are common defense evasion techniques employed to reduce the chances of immediate discovery by standard system monitoring or user inspection.

* **Mapped MITRE Techniques:**

| Tactic          | Technique ID | Description                                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Defense Evasion | T1564.001    | Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories - Moving files to a non-standard "backup" directory within `C:\ProgramData` is an attempt to conceal them from casual observation. |
| Defense Evasion | T1070.004    | Indicator Removal: File Deletion - Although the files are moved rather than permanently deleted from the system, this action serves to remove them from their initial, more conspicuous creation points, thereby cleaning up the attacker's immediate traces. |

**Software Management** | Implement software restriction policies to prevent unauthorized software (like `7-Zip` installers) from being downloaded and silently installed from untrusted sources.
**Network Security** | Enforce egress filtering to restrict outbound connections to known good destinations and block connections to suspicious cloud storage services.
**Application Control** | Restrict the execution of unsigned or untrusted PowerShell scripts.
**Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** | Implement DLP solutions to detect and prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data, regardless of the compression method used.

## 10. Conclusion

The investigation into `danielletargetm` successfully identified a **data exfiltration attempt**. The `exfiltratedata.ps1` script demonstrated a **multi-stage attack lifecycle**, including:

- Tool transfer and execution  
- Data staging and compression  
- Exfiltration to external infrastructure  
- Defense evasion through persistence mechanisms

Although this activity was performed in a **controlled environment**, the **techniques and indicators of compromise (IOCs)** observed are directly applicable to real-world insider threat scenarios.

Notably, the activity occurred over multiple days, reinforcing the need for:

- **Continuous endpoint monitoring**
- **Behavior-based anomaly detection**
- **Proactive threat hunting practices**

Should such activity be detected in a production environment, **immediate escalation, containment, and comprehensive remediation** would be essential to protect corporate data and maintain operational integrity.
